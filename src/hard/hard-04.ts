  ### Question

  With too much traffic one needs to reduce the incoming number of vehicles.
  Now we handle the stream by removing some of the vehicles.

  Using the imported cars$ stream, only get the manufacturer of the vehicle when there hasn't been an activity for 500ms

  ### Hints

  ### Expected Result

  Volvo
  Koenigsegg
